# Multitenancy Project Management

This is an SAAS application in which an organization's account is paid by a single user.

The organization's owner then can invite additional members to the organization by email

## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        $ gem install rails

3. Change directory to `myapp` or whatever the folder name is and start the web server:

        $ cd myapp
        $ rails server

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

4. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`
